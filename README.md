# Autonomous-Robot
This project involves the creation of an autonomous mobile robot equipped with YOLOv5 for object detection and tested in a 3D simulator called Gazebo.

## Introduction
The Autonomous Mobile Robot project aims to develop a robot capable of navigating its environment autonomously while detecting and recognizing objects using YOLOv5. The project leverages Gazebo for simulation, allowing for thorough testing and development in a virtual environment.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
- **Simulation Environment**: Uses Gazebo for 3D simulation and testing.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Implements algorithms for autonomous movement and obstacle avoidance.

## Installation
- Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- ROS
- Gazebo 11
- CUDA 10.2+ (for GPU support)
- Pytorch 1.6.0+
- OpenCV 4.5.1+
